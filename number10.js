// JavaScript Objects: Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs,
//  where each key (or property) is a string and each value can
//  be any data type (number, string, boolean, array, function,etc)


// Difference:
// Objects are typically used to represent a collection of related data with
//  named properties,whereas arrays are used to store ordered collections of data.

// In arrays, data is accessed using an index number (like array[0]), but in objects, 
// data is accessed using a key or property name (like object.key).
